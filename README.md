Don't use arrow functions for event callbacks - 'this' event is not binded to the callback
Don't use arrow functions for accessing or updating properties - 'this' is not understood
Every times the property value change, every use case rerendered in the template
Use 'v-once' to render the use case once, don't rerender the applied element on property-update
Order parameters carefully working with methods
